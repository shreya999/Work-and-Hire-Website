RELATIONSHIPS</strong><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employer and Freelancer.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(1)&nbsp;Project Agreement.&nbsp;The engagement, contracting and management of a project are between an Employer and a Freelancer. Upon acceptance of a quote, the Employer agrees to purchase, and the Freelancer agrees to deliver, the services and related deliverables in accordance with the following agreements: (a) the agreement between Employer and Freelancer including the Project Bid, Project Description, and other terms and conditions as communicated between Employer and Freelancer on the Website or otherwise, (b) these Terms of Service, and (c) any other content uploaded to the Website by either party (collectively, the &ldquo;Project Agreement&rdquo;). You agree not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with these Terms of Service. Any provision of a Project Agreement in conflict with these Terms of Service is void. Employer is responsible for managing, inspecting, accepting and paying for satisfactory services and deliverables in accordance with the Project Agreement in a timely manner. Freelancer is responsible for the performance and quality of the services in accordance with the Project Agreement in a timely manner. Employer and Freelancer each covenants and agrees to act with good faith and fair dealing in performance of the Project Agreement.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(2)&nbsp;Independence.&nbsp;Employer and Freelancer each acknowledges and agrees that their relationship is that of independent contractors. The Freelancer shall perform services as an independent contractor and nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employer-employee relationship between Freelancer and Employer or between Work N Hire and any Employer or Freelancer.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">B.&nbsp;Registered Users and Work N Hire.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(1)&nbsp;General.&nbsp;Work N Hire is not a party to the dealing, contracting and fulfillment of any Project between an Employer and a Freelancer. Work N Hire has no control over and does not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of any services performed or deliverables created, advertised, the truth or accuracy of project listings, the qualifications, background, or abilities of Registered Users, the ability of Freelancers to perform services, the ability of Employers to pay for services, or that an Employer or Freelancer can or will actually complete a Project. Work N Hire is not responsible for and will not control the manner in which a Freelancer operates and is not involved in the hiring, firing, discipline or working conditions of the Freelancer. All rights and obligations for the purchase and sale of services or other deliverables are solely between an Employer and a Freelancer. Work N Hire will not provide any Freelancer with any materials or tools to complete any Project. Employers and Freelancers must look solely to the other for enforcement and performance of all the rights and obligations arising from Project Agreements and any other terms, conditions, representations, or warranties associated with such dealings.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(2)&nbsp;Third-Party Beneficiary of Project Agreement.&nbsp;Employer and Freelancer each acknowledges and agrees that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Website depend on their performance of their covenants and agreements as set forth in their Project Agreement. Employer and Freelancer therefore appoint Work N Hire as a third-party beneficiary of their Project Agreement for purposes of enforcing the obligations owed to, and the benefits conferred on, Work N Hire by these Terms of Service. Employers and Freelancers further agree that Work N Hire has the right to take such actions with respect to the Project Agreement or their Accounts, including without limitation, suspension, termination, or any other legal actions, as Work N Hire in its sole discretion deems necessary to protect the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Website.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(3)&nbsp;Agency.&nbsp;These Terms of Service and any registration for or subsequent use of this Website by any user or Registered User will not be construed as creating or implying any relationship of agency, franchise, partnership or joint venture between you and Work N Hire, except and solely to the extent expressly stated.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(4)&nbsp;Taxes.&nbsp;Registered Users are responsible for payment and reporting of any taxes. Work N Hire is not obligated to determine the applicability of any taxes or to remit, collect or report any such applicable taxes. You agree that you will abide by any and all applicable state and government tax statutes, regulations and common law. In the event Work N Hire receives a notice of non-compliance with any such statute, regulation or common law, Work N Hire will deem such receipt a breach of this section and will suspend your Account.</span><br /><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;"><strong>4.

The fee is based on a Freelancer&rsquo;s profile membership type and is deducted from the total amount paid by an Employer for a Project. Freelancer&rsquo;s are charged a 5%(promotional) Project Fee.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(2)&nbsp;Employer Payment Processing Fee.&nbsp;If an Employer pays a Freelancer, an Employer Payment Processing Fee depending on the mode of payment will be charged to the Freelancer.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(3)&nbsp;Freelancer Transfer Method Fee.&nbsp;If, upon a Freelancer&rsquo;s request, funds are to be disbursed via check or an NEFT transfer or through Paypal a Freelancer Transfer Method Fee will be charged to the Freelancer as described on the Website.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(4)&nbsp;Dispute Resolution Service Fee.&nbsp;For use of Dispute Resolution Service, irrespective of the nature of resolution and any resulting disbursements, Work N Hire charges a Dispute Resolution Service Fee, equal to the greater of Rs 500 and five percent (5%) of the total amount paid by an Employer to Work N Hire for the applicable project to which such payment relates.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">C. We reserve the right to change membership fees, service fees, processing fees or any other fee that may be charged by Work N Hire at any time, at the sole discretion of Work N Hire and upon reasonable notice posted in advance on the Website. No refunds of fees already paid will be given. If we exercise our right to cancel a membership as provided under these Terms of Service, at any time, we will not refund the membership fee already paid.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">5. WORK N HIRE BILLING AND PAYMENT SERVICES</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">A.&nbsp;Work N Hire Invoice Service.&nbsp;The Work N Hire Invoice Service enables Freelancers to issue invoices and enables Employers to make payments for services.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(1)&nbsp;General.&nbsp;When a Freelancer completes a Project for an Employer, the Freelancer will complete the electronic invoice form (the &ldquo;Invoice&rdquo;) and submit it to Work N Hire via the Website. A Freelancer must complete and submit an Invoice to Work N Hire for each and every Project. The Freelancer will provide Work N Hire with a list of items, including, but not limited to, hours worked, payment required and description of Project(s), to be included on the Invoice (&ldquo;Invoice Details&ldquo;).&nbsp;Such Invoice Details will not be final until and unless such Freelancer has confirmed the accuracy of the Invoice Details or waived the right to review the Invoice Details. If a Professional waives his, her or its right to review the Invoice Details, all items in the Invoice Details will be included on the Invoice as received by Work N Hire.&nbsp;WORK N HIRE ENCOURAGES ALL FREELANCERS TO REVIEW INVOICE DETAILS. Work N Hire will submit the Invoice to the Employer and the Employer shall submit the payment specified in the Invoice (&ldquo;Payment&ldquo;) to Work N Hire.&nbsp;When an Employer makes a payment through the Work N Hire Invoice Service, Work N Hire deducts the appropriate Service Charges due Work N Hire as described on the Website and delivers the remainder of the Payment to the Freelancer.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(2)&nbsp;Invoice Disputes.&nbsp;If an Employer reasonably disputes any Invoice, the Employer will pay all undisputed amounts within the time frames specified above and the parties will cooperate to verify any disputed amounts. Any Invoice amounts reasonably disputed by an Employer will not be payable to a Freelancer until such dispute is resolved. Work N Hire&rsquo;s obligation to pay any Payment (less applicable Service Charge) is expressly conditioned upon: (a) Work N Hire&rsquo;s receipt of Payment from the applicable Employer and (b) resolution of all outstanding disputes with respect to such Invoice and/or Payment.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">B.&nbsp;Escrow Service. The Escrow Service enables Employers to transfer certain payment responsibilities to Work N Hire.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(1)&nbsp;General.&nbsp;At an Employer&rsquo;s request, upon payment to Work N Hire by Employer for services to be rendered by a Freelancer, Work N Hire will assume responsibility for the payment for such Freelancer&rsquo;s services (less applicable Service Charge). Work N Hire agrees not to pay Freelancers for services until after the occurrence of an Employer&rsquo;s Acceptance of Services. You acknowledge that such funds will belong to Work N Hire immediately upon such funds being transferred to Work N Hire by you. However, Work N Hire agrees to refund such funds to Employer in the event that (y) a Freelancer acknowledges that services have not been completed or (z) Employer and Freelancer have concluded the process comprising the Dispute Resolution Service with a result indicating that Employer is the rightful recipient of such funds. Work N Hire agrees to keep both Employer and Freelancer informed as to the status of the Assumed Payment Liability and if, for any reason, a party requests Dispute Resolution Service regarding such status, will notify both parties that the matter will be addressed through the Dispute Resolution Service.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(2)&nbsp;Escrow Disputes.&nbsp;If an Employer or Freelancer reasonably disputes the quality or completion of services provided by such Freelancer, then both Employer and Freelancer agree that Work N Hire shall have no payment obligations to any party related to relevant fees until such dispute is resolved in accordance with Section 6 below. Work N Hire&rsquo;s obligation to pay any Payment (less applicable Service Charge) is expressly conditioned upon resolution of all outstanding disputes with respect to such Payment.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">C.&nbsp;Funds Transfer.</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">(1)&nbsp;General.&nbsp;To receive funds due to you, you must request such funds and indicate your selection of the funds transfer methods available on the Website. Any such requests shall be subject to the conditions and restrictions contained on the Website and in these Terms of Service.
